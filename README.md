# VirusShareSant
## _A Malware Dataset for Windows Plataform_

VirusShareSant is a Malware Dataset based on [VirusShare] and it was created based on the following criterias:

- The goal of the analysis: the chosen goal was malware family classification;
- The malware's execution plafaform: In [[1]](#1), 51.08% of all detected malware run on Microsoft Windows Plataform. So, the chosen plataform for VirusShareSant was Windows;
- The amount of labeled samples: The malware dataset provided in Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge (BIG 2015)  [[2]](#2) makes avaliable 21 thousant samples, but only half of them are labeled. So, we've considered VirusShareSant should be bigger. 
- Binary avaliability: all samples are avaliable under request for research purpose.
